Small boilerplate 3D Graphics setup using WebGl 2. Does all the goundwork from loading models and shaders to tracking objects and cameras around automatically.
Didn't use three.js because I just like vanilla.js better, together with the learning experience, also because this needs to modify things during loading process.  
Of course as a hobby-project, this needs some cleanup and and more documentation, but should serve at least for demonstrating that I can work some nice code.
