# demo-site
Small boilerplate 3D Graphics setup using WebGl 2. Does all the goundwork from loading models and shaders to tracking objects and cameras around.  
Didn't use three.js because I just like vanilla.js better, together with the learning experience.  
Of course, this needs some cleanup and and more documentation, but should serve at least at demonstrating that I can work some nice code.  
# Looking for a job
I'm currently looking for a new job, because working as a forced-volunteer maintainer for decade old legacy access applications that should have been replaced by HPC-programmed solutions years ago is just hell. Throw your worst projects at me, I'll fix and doc them and I'll thrive in the challenge.  
location: remote  
hours: 30h/week  
languages: anything, if you want me to code a typescript-to-cobol converter in ruby, fine, I can do it. (aside that it probably exists already)
