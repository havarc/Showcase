# Showcase
Small boilerplate 3D Graphics setup using WebGl 2. Does all the groundwork from loading models and shaders to tracking objects and cameras around including flexible input assignment. Also creates Widgets with all kinds of content, they can be moved, resized and snap to the window border and each other.
With all the backend handled, a scene can be setup by simply creating nodes and attaching models and key/mouse functions to them, see setup-editor.js for demonstration.

Didn't use three.js because I just like vanilla.js better, together with the learning experience.  
Of course, this needs some cleanup and and more documentation, but should serve at least at demonstrating that I can work some nice code.
